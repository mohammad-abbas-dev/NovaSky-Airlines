this is my very first webite using html and css in a really serious way atleast for me for now :) 

**what to expect**
this code main objective is to train on css in general especially on :
-animations/transitions
-the menu you can see known as hamburger menu or hamburger menu icon
-also abit of background skills 

---> if your aim is to enhance your skills then try to not look at the codes utill you try doig it yourself (it took me more than 5hours for my current level
and i had to edit it alot so dont give up :D )

--->im going to continue for more and better websites inshallah and i hope you a goodluck too
